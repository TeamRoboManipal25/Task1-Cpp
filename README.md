# 📄 Task Description

For this task, you will practice writing basic C++ programs and pushing your code to GitHub using the **Git CLI**.  
There is **no separate report** for this task.

👉 Two PDF guides will be provided:

- [First Year PDF](task2_first_year.pdf) → C++ basics  
- [Second Year PDF](task2_second_year.pdf) → Slightly advanced C++ concepts  

Follow the respective PDF as per your year.

## 🛠️ What You Have to Do  

1. Write the required C++ programs as instructed in the PDF.  
2. Push your code to your private repository in the **RoboManipal2025** organization.  
3. Follow the folder structure rule:  

```

YourRepoName/
├── Task0/
│   └── (files for Task 0)
├── Task1/
│   └── (files for Task 1)
├── Task2/
│   ├── program1.cpp
│   ├── program2.cpp
│   └── ...

````

- Keep all Task 2 related files inside the `Task2` folder.  
- Name your `.cpp` files meaningfully (e.g., `Isprime.cpp`, `Palindrome.cpp`).
